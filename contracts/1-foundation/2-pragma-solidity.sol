/*
In Solidity (the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts), 
the pragma statement defines the default version of the Solidity compiler to be used. 
Thepragma is a directive that specifies the version of the compiler to use when compiling your contract code. 
It's essential to include this line at the top of your solidity file, as it helps prevent compatibility issues between different versions.
